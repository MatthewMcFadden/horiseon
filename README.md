# Horiseon:
This project is a fake website and I was tasked with fixing and updating the code to make it easier to read and more accessible to the user.

### Changes that I have done
-fixed and added a Horiseon main page link
-fixed header links so that it accesses the links on the page
-renamed div tags with header, footer, nav, and article tags to make the code easier to read and more up to date.
-added comments above each section of the code for the reader to know what the code is doing
-also added comments on what I have changed
-cleaned up the CSS and removed duplicate code
-updated the css reference tags that were deleted so the website kept the same look
