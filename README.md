# Horiseon:
This project is a fake website and I was tasked with fixing and updating the code to make it easier to read and more accessible to the user.

### Changes that I have done
-fixed and added a Horiseon main page link <br/>
-fixed header links so that it accesses the links on the page <br/>
-renamed div tags with header, footer, nav, and article tags to make the code easier to read and more up to date. <br/>
-added comments above each section of the code for the reader to know what the code is doing <br/>
-also added comments on what I have changed <br/>
-cleaned up the CSS and removed duplicate code <br/>
-updated the css reference tags that were deleted so the website kept the same look
